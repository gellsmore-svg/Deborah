# Cairn — a process meta-language

**Specification v0.9** · maintained by **[Deborah](https://github.com/gellsmore-svg/Deborah)**

Cairn is a simple, textual, human-readable meta-language for describing complex
processes — especially agentic / LLM-centric ones — so that humans and LLMs can
read, write, compare, and reason about the same description.

> **Naming.** *Cairn* is the **document format** this specification defines —
> `.cairn.md` files, ```` ```cairn ```` fences, the constructs below. The Python
> package that implements it is **`deborah`** (it was called `cairn` until
> v0.9.0, when the human-systems analysis half split off into `huldah`). The
> format did not change in that split; the grammar here is identical to v0.8.2.

This document is the specification. For the why, see
[README.md](README.md) (Purpose & Philosophy).

---

## 0. Reading guide

The **golden rule** comes first, because everything else serves it:

> When someone reads a Cairn description, they should think *"I get what's
> happening here,"* not *"I need to learn the notation first."*

So Cairn is **human-first**. Formality is **optional and progressive**: you add
precision only where it matters, and the readable flow stays clean. Where machine
precision is needed (for validation or AI execution), it lives in a **Formal**
layer that an AI keeps in sync with the **Narrative** human reading — both are
two views of one shared structure (§4).

---

## 1. Document structure — three modes

An Cairn document is built from three kinds of block. A document may use any
subset, in any combination.

| Mode | Answers | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| **CONTEXT** | "what world are we in?" | scene-setting, definitions, frames |
| **REQUIREMENTS / OUTCOMES** | "what must be true?" | declarative, testable assertions |
| **PROCESS** | "how does it flow?" | the numbered, imperative steps |

Keeping these three distinct is deliberate: requirements are *assertions* (with
acceptance criteria), not control flow, and scene-setting is *background*, not
steps. Mixing them is what makes most design docs hard to follow.

---

## 2. Design principles

1. **Human-first readability.** Concrete everyday words, short active sentences.
   Structure scaffolds; it never gets in the way.
2. **Least abstraction that works.** Don't invent a symbol where a plain word
   will do.
3. **Progressive formality.** The default is terse and readable. Precision
   (modifiers, state scopes, acceptance criteria) is added only where it earns
   its keep. Sensible defaults apply when a modifier is omitted.
4. **One structure, many profiles.** A single canonical backbone is *projected*
   into audience render profiles (precise `ai`, readable `operator`, and more);
   you author once and a tool/AI renders the rest (§3).
5. **Consistency through core verbs** (§5.3) — a recommended lexicon, never a
   rule. Clarity always wins over adherence.
6. **Practical and evolving.** Cairn is used "in anger" on real projects; the
   reserved vocabulary (verbs, tags) grows from real use, not theory.

---

## 3. The shared backbone and its render profiles

Every Cairn description has one **canonical backbone**:

- the **numbering** (`1.`, `2.1`, …) and indentation (sequence + hierarchy),
- the **construct** each step is (STEP, ITERATE, DECISION, …),
- the **tags** (§7) and **state references** (§6) on a step,
- any **formal modifiers** on a construct (e.g. `ITERATE [MAX: 5]`).

The backbone is the single source of truth. It is **projected** into one of
several **render profiles** for a given audience. You author the backbone once; a
tool or AI renders the profile. You do **not** hand-maintain multiple versions.

### 3.1 Render profiles

A profile projects the backbone with rules for what to **expose**, what to
**compress**, and how to phrase it. The standard profiles:

| Profile | For | Exposes | Compresses | Reads like |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ai` | machines / execution | everything: every step, modifier, tag, state | nothing | a precise, complete skeleton |
| `operator` | the person running it | intent, ownership, decisions, iteration, milestones, outputs | internal calls, mechanical sub-steps | a guided operational narrative |
| `human_demand` | UX / service / change designers | awareness, action load, closure, recovery, simulation findings | technical mechanism not relevant to the human burden | a human-load review |
| `executive` | sponsors / overview | milestones, owners, outcomes, key decisions | almost all mechanism | a one-glance status story |
| `audit` | review / compliance | everything significant + decisions, constraints, provenance, who-did-what | low-value mechanics only | a defensible record |

`ai` and `operator` are the **canonical pair** (the precise form and the readable
form); `executive` and `audit` are further projections of the *same* backbone.

Select a profile with a directive: `render-profile: operator`. Profiles other than
`ai` are lossy **by design**; when they seem to disagree, the `ai` projection wins
for machine semantics — the others are never authoritative.

For these projections to work, the backbone carries the needed signal: **PURPOSE**
(intent, §5), **MILESTONE** (major transitions, §5), **Actor / ASSISTED-BY**
(ownership vs. contribution, §7), and the always-significant constructs (DECISION,
CONSTRAINTS, OUTPUT, AWAIT, GATED) that every profile but the most compressed
exposes.

### 3.2 The operator (human) profile

The headline human view. It answers, for each phase: *what is happening, why, who
owns it, what changed, what's next* — without implementation detail. For each
MILESTONE / PROCESS it renders **Purpose** (the `PURPOSE:` intent), **Owner** (the
Actor, a role if named), **Assisted by** (the `ASSISTED-BY` actors), **Outputs**
(key `OUTPUT`s / OUTCOMES), **Iterate until** (the `ITERATE [UNTIL: …]` condition,
when present), and **Next** (the following MILESTONE). It compresses internal
`CALL`s and mechanical `[CODE]` sub-steps, and always exposes decisions,
constraints, and outputs.

```
FRAME Opportunity
  Purpose:       Convert a customer need into executable context.
  Owner:         Product Lead
  Assisted by:   LLM
  Outputs:       specification, constraints, acceptance criteria
  Iterate until: confidence threshold satisfied
  Next:          BUILD Solution
```

**Success criterion:** a human grasps purpose, ownership, progress, and iteration
without reading mechanism. **Guardrail:** if removing a keyword or structure makes
understanding *harder*, the profile is over-compressed — restore it.

### 3.3 Human demand mapping

Human-facing steps carry more than operational work. They ask people to notice,
understand, decide, remember, trust, recover, and close loops. Cairn may model
that demand directly so process design can treat human capacity as part of the
system, not an afterthought.

The recommended backbone is:

- **ORIENT** - how the person becomes aware that something needs attention, and
  what they must understand before useful action is possible.
- **ACT** - the work, judgement, decision, correction, or delegation the person
  performs.
- **CLOSE** - how the person knows the work is done, what state changed, and what
  they should expect next.
- **RECOVER** - optional paths for confusion, missing information, overload,
  error, reversal, or escalation.
- **ADAPT** - optional learning, role change, trust recalibration, habit change,
  or organisational effect from repeated use.

Use `HUMAN_DEMAND:` for this arc. Add `SUPPORT:` for what the system provides to
meet the demand, `TRUST:` for what makes reliance justified, and `CHANGE_IMPACT:`
when the process changes skills, roles, authority, incentives, or accountability.

For AI-assisted UX review, use `HUMAN_SIMULATION:` to describe an AI role-play
pass: role, expertise, visible context, task goal, and test cases. Use
`HUMAN_LOAD:` or `SIMULATION_FINDINGS:` to record observed load: focus actions,
trivial actions, explicit decisions, context switches, missing-context events,
recursions, input burden, and closure clarity. Use `HUMAN_FACTORS:` to name the
plausible cognitive, psychological, social, organisational, behavioural-economic,
or incentive forces present in the step. Use `HUMAN_RISK:` for qualitative
probability, impact, confidence, score, and rationale.

```
3. Review the AI-generated invoice exception summary. [HUMAN, ASSISTED-BY: LLM, GATED]
   HUMAN_DEMAND:
     ORIENT: notice why this invoice needs attention.
     ACT: compare the summary with invoice, purchase order, receipt, and policy.
     CLOSE: record a decision and see the case leave the open queue.
     RECOVER: request missing evidence or escalate to a manager.
   HUMAN_LOAD:
     business_actions: 2
     navigation_actions: 4
     context_switches: 5
     uncertainty_loops: 2
   HUMAN_FACTORS:
     cognitive_load: context switching, working memory burden.
     trust_automation: automation bias if recommendation appears before evidence.
   HUMAN_RISK:
     probability: high
     impact: high
     confidence: medium
     score: critical
     rationale: the person is accountable for a high-consequence decision while carrying uncertainty and tool overhead.
   TRUST: show source evidence and uncertainty before approval.
```

**Success criterion:** the process makes visible what it asks of the human, why
that demand is justified, and what support keeps the human from becoming a
rubber stamp or hidden failure point.

## 4. Core grammar

### 4.1 PROCESS

The top-level container. It has a **signature** (§11):

```
PROCESS <Name> (INPUT: <…>; OUTPUT: <…>)
```

### 4.2 Numbered hierarchy

Steps are numbered for sequence; indentation + dotted numbers show nesting:

```
1. …
2. …
   2.1 …
   2.2 …
3. …
```

### 4.3 Core verbs (recommended lexicon)

Start a step with one of these where it fits — it gives Cairn its scannable
"process feel." **Recommended, not required.**

`Initialize/Setup` · `Propose/Generate` · `Evaluate/Score` · `Decide/Choose` ·
`Update/Refine` · `Execute/Call` · `Iterate/Recurse` · `Queue/Negotiate` ·
`Merge/Output` · `Handle/Retry`

### 4.4 Steps and step-blocks

A step is a line; it may carry indented sub-blocks:

```
3. Evaluate each candidate for relevance. [LLM, STOCHASTIC]
   CONSTRAINTS: judge only against the original request.
   STATE UPDATE: useful_chunks += kept_ids
   OUTPUT: kept_ids, dropped_ids
   RISKS: a weak model may over-keep; the Python pre-rank bounds the set.
```

Sub-block keywords: `STATE UPDATE`, `OUTPUT`, `RISKS`, `CONSTRAINTS` /
`BOUNDARIES`, `CONTEXT`, `PURPOSE`, human-demand blocks (`HUMAN_DEMAND`,
`HUMAN_LOAD`, `HUMAN_SIMULATION`, `HUMAN_FACTORS`, `HUMAN_RISK`, `TRUST`,
`SUPPORT`, `FAILURE_MODE`, `SIMULATION_FINDINGS`, `IMPROVEMENT`,
`CHANGE_IMPACT`), or nested numbered steps.


### 4.5 PLAN — a live, revisable process instance

`PROCESS` defines a reusable flow. `PLAN` identifies one live application of a
process to a request and records how that application changes as new information
arrives.

```text
PLAN <plan-id> REVISION <n> [STATUS: draft|active|stable|complete|blocked]
  PARENT: <revision number or none>
  REQUEST: <the request this plan serves>
  TRIGGER: <new information that caused this revision, or initial_request>

  PROCESS <Name> (INPUT: ...; OUTPUT: ...)
    ... normal Cairn process backbone ...
```

A plan revision:

- preserves the same `plan-id` and increments `REVISION`;
- names its parent revision, except revision 1;
- records the information that justified the change;
- contains a complete process backbone, not an ambiguous patch;
- must retain hard constraints and stopping bounds unless an authorised human or
  governing process explicitly changes them;
- may finish as `stable` when no change is warranted, `complete` when its outcome
  has been reached, or `blocked` when progress requires unavailable authority or
  information.

LLM-produced plans and revisions require bounded iteration. The runtime validates
the plan structure and remains responsible for tool permissions, side effects,
budgets, persistence, and termination. A `PLAN` is operational state, not trusted
knowledge; promoting its claims into memory is a separate governed action.

### 4.6 PLAN interpretation — live step execution

A `PLAN` may be **interpreted** — walked step-by-step by a runtime that enforces
`depends_on`, `allowed_tools`, and per-step status transitions — rather than
executed only as narrative around a monolithic pipeline.

**Step state machine** (machine plans; prose plans may omit explicit status):

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Not started; dependencies may be unsatisfied |
| `active` | Currently executing |
| `completed` | Succeeded; outputs available to dependents |
| `blocked` | Cannot proceed (missing handler, failed guard, unavailable tool) |
| `skipped` | Intentionally not run (deferred construct, duplicate effect, policy) |

**Interpretation order:** a step runs only when every `depends_on` id is
`completed`. Steps with no unresolved dependencies are **ready**; the runtime picks
from the ready set (typically ascending `id` / document order).

**Dispatch by construct:**

- `STEP` — acknowledge or execute. A pure framing step with no `allowed_tools`
  may complete as an acknowledged intent. A step tagged `[LLM, STOCHASTIC]` needs
  a stochastic handler or must delegate to a governed `CALL`.
- `CALL` — invoke a registered handler. The handler set **must** be a subset of
  `allowed_tools` on that step. Unknown tools → `blocked`, not silent fallback.
- `ITERATE` / `DECISION` / `RECURSE` — either expand into an inner interpreter
  loop with explicit bounds, or `skip` with trace when an outer revision loop
  already owns recursion (common for `RECURSE` on revision 1).

**Execution context** crosses steps through a bounded artifact map (step id →
output) and the `PROCESS` signature — not through callee-private `STATE` (§6.5).

**Trace:** each transition emits a process event (`plan.step.started`,
`plan.step.completed`, …) separate from the answer payload. Interpretation trace +
plan revision lineage together form the auditable record.

**Degenerate case:** a single `CALL` step whose handler runs the full legacy
pipeline is valid — interpretation collapses to today's monolithic executor. The
value of interpretation is **granular tool gating**, **resumability**, and
**honest step status** when plans grow beyond one blob.

**Planner vs interpreter:** the planner LLM proposes steps; the interpreter never
widens `allowed_tools` or skips `depends_on`. Revisions replace the backbone;
the interpreter may resume from the first `pending`/`blocked` step on the new
revision.

---

## 5. Constructs

Each construct below lists its **meaning**, optional **formal modifiers** (with
defaults), and how it reads in **Narrative**. Modifiers are the "progressive
formality" lever — omit them and the default applies.

### MILESTONE
A major transition / phase in a process (e.g. `FRAME`, `BUILD`, `VERIFY`,
`RELEASE`). Marks the points the `operator` / `executive` profiles surface.
- Formal: `MILESTONE <Name>` heading a step or group.
- Top-level steps may be treated as milestones implicitly; `MILESTONE` makes a
  significant transition explicit.

### PURPOSE
A one-line statement of **intent** on a PROCESS, MILESTONE, or step — *why* it
exists, not *how* it works. The `operator` profile renders it as "Purpose:".
- Formal: `PURPOSE: <intent>` (a sub-block, like OUTPUT/RISKS).

### STEP
A single action. The default construct; the verb carries the meaning.

A step may perform **many similar calls at once** (a fan-out / batch) and still be
*one* step — e.g. "run the requested tool calls." Tag it `[BATCH]` (optionally
`[BATCH: n]`) when the multiplicity matters. Use **PARALLEL** only for genuinely
*concurrent branches with independent control flow*, not for a loop or batch of
like calls.

### ITERATE
Repeat a block.
- Formal: `ITERATE [UNTIL: <condition>; MAX: <n>]`
  - `UNTIL` — termination condition (default: until the body signals done). The
    condition may reference state the body sets (e.g. `UNTIL: decision.status =
    done`).
  - `MAX` — hard cap on rounds (default: required for any LLM-driven loop).
- Loop control: a step inside the body may `BREAK` (exit the loop) or `CONTINUE`
  (skip to the next round) — see below. This is the explicit way to leave a loop
  early, rather than relying on a DECISION to "fall out."
- Narrative: *"Iterate, refining …, until <condition> or after at most <n>
  rounds."*

### BREAK / CONTINUE
Loop control inside ITERATE / QUEUE.
- `BREAK [IF: <condition>]` — leave the enclosing loop now (optionally only when
  the condition holds).
- `CONTINUE [IF: <condition>]` — skip the rest of this round and start the next.
- Prefer these over a DECISION whose only job is to exit a loop.

### RECURSE
A process that calls itself. **Recursion *is* a self-`CALL`** — `RECURSE` is the
same act as `CALL <ThisProcess>(…)` with the two guards below; don't write both
for the same recursion.
- Formal: `RECURSE [BASE: <condition>; MAX_DEPTH: <n>]`
  - `BASE` — base case (required). `MAX_DEPTH` — depth guard.

### QUEUE
Serialized / turn-based flow (e.g. agents taking turns).
- Formal: `QUEUE [ORDER: FIFO|PRIORITY|ROUND_ROBIN; ONE_AT_A_TIME]`
  - `ORDER` default `FIFO`. `ONE_AT_A_TIME` is the default for agent turns.

### PARALLEL … MERGE
Concurrent sub-branches that **join** at a MERGE.
- Formal: `PARALLEL [STATE: isolated|shared] … MERGE [<rule>]`
  - `STATE` default `isolated` (branches do **not** see each other's
    `STATE UPDATE`s until MERGE). `MERGE` states how outputs combine.
- Branches use letters: `3a.`, `3b.`, then a `MERGE` step.
- For concurrency that **never joins** (long-running services), use SERVICE.

### SERVICE
A long-running, concurrent activity that does **not** join — e.g. a worker loop,
a watched-folder ingester, a broker consumer. Several SERVICEs typically run at
once over **shared** state and continue until stopped.
- Formal: `SERVICE <Name> [UNTIL: stop]` — usually an `ITERATE [UNTIL: stop]` body.
- Run a set concurrently with `CONCURRENT { SERVICE a; SERVICE b; … }`
  (the non-joining counterpart of PARALLEL); name the shared state they operate on.

### DECISION
A branch point.
- Inline (one-liners): `DECISION [ON: <value>] → <branch-A> | <branch-B> | …`
- With **branch bodies** (multi-step): name branches with letters and nest their
  steps, like PARALLEL — `2a.` … / `2b.` … under the DECISION.
- Narrative: *"If <…>, then …; otherwise …."*

### RETRY
Re-attempt on transient failure.
- Formal: `RETRY [MAX: <n>; BACKOFF: none|linear|exponential]` (defaults `MAX: 3`,
  `BACKOFF: exponential`).

### ERROR
Handle / propagate a failure.
- Formal: `ERROR [ON: <type>; THEN: handle|fallback|propagate]`
  (default `propagate` to the parent PROCESS).
- When `THEN` is `fallback` (or `handle`), **name the target**:
  `ERROR [ON: malformed; THEN: fallback → stop with current context]`. The arrow
  gives the concrete recovery, not just the mode.

### AWAIT
Suspend until an external event — a human approval, a system signal, a timeout.
Real processes *wait*: a `[GATED, HUMAN]` write waits for an operator; a crash-safe
egress waits for a broker ack. The process resumes (or times out) when the event
arrives.
- Formal: `AWAIT [EVENT: <what>; TIMEOUT: <duration|never>; THEN: <on-timeout>]`
- Example: `AWAIT [EVENT: operator approves the proposed meaning; TIMEOUT: never]`.
- State held across an AWAIT is whatever its scope keeps (§6); the wait may
  outlive a restart, so durable scope is what survives.

### ATOMIC / DURABLE-BEFORE  (ordering & recovery)
Crash-safe systems hinge on *ordering between steps* and *what happens if a crash
lands between them*. Make that explicit instead of burying it in prose:
- `DURABLE-BEFORE: <step>` on a step — this step's effect must be durable **before**
  `<step>` runs (e.g. "enqueue is durable before the broker offset is committed").

### Domain-specific constructs (from proposals)

These are first-class for richer domain modeling. They parse as constructs with optional [modifiers].

**Psychological:**
- `REGULATION [STRATEGY: reappraisal | suppression | ...] [TARGET: situation | attention | cognition | response] [GOAL: hedonic | instrumental | eudaimonic]`
- `APPRAISAL [TYPE: primary | secondary]`
- `DUAL_PROCESS [SYSTEM: 1 | 2]`
- `METACOGNITION [MONITOR | CONTROL]`
- `FEEDBACK [FROM: ... ; VIA: ...]`  (* for loops like emotion regulation feeding back into appraisal *)
- `FEEDBACK` can be used to model feedback in psych/org/socio systems (e.g. outcome reflection informing next iteration).
- `MACRO` for higher-level patterns (e.g. `MACRO VISION-CASCADE` as a reusable chunk).

**Organisational:**
- `ALIGN [ELEMENTS: strategy | structure | culture | ...]`
- `COALITION [BUILD | SUSTAIN]`
- `RESISTANCE [TYPE: active | passive | cultural] [OVERCOME: via ...]`
- `REINFORCEMENT [MECHANISM: reward | ritual | metric | story]`
- `CASCADE [DIRECTION: top-down | bottom-up] [CONTENT: vision | goals | ...]`
- `VISION [FORM | COMMUNICATE | ANCHOR]`

**Sociological:**
- `SOCIALIZE [TYPE: primary | secondary]`
- `INSTITUTIONALIZE`
- `SYMBOLIC_INTERACTION [MEANING: ...]`
- `CONFLICT`
- `ACCOMMODATE | ASSIMILATE`
- `ROLE [CONFLICT | TAKING]`

New tags (see §7): [EMOTIONAL], [COGNITIVE], [LEADERSHIP], [STRATEGIC], [CULTURAL], [POWER], [SOCIAL], [GROUP], [NORM], [ROLE], [SYMBOLIC], etc.

Use `EMERGENT [TYPE: psychological | organisational | social]` or qualified like `EMERGENT [PSYCHOLOGICAL: insight]`.

Multi-level STATE: `STATE foo [scope: individual | team | org; dir: read/write]`

These are additive; existing documents remain valid.

## Render Profiles for Domains

New profiles for human-system work:
- `therapeutic` — emphasises regulation, appraisal, feedback.
- `change_leader` — emphasises coalition, resistance, alignment, reinforcement.
- `human_demand` — emphasises ORIENT / ACT / CLOSE demand, simulation findings,
  support, trust, recovery, and change impact.
- `human_factors` — emphasises plausible cognitive, psychological, social,
  organisational, behavioural-economic, and incentive forces, with qualitative
  risk estimates.

Use `deborah-render ... --profile therapeutic`, `change_leader`, or
`human_demand` / `human_factors`.
- `ATOMIC { … }` — a group whose effect is all-or-nothing.
- `RECOVERY: <action>` — a step/process annotation stating what happens if a crash
  interrupts here on restart (e.g. `RECOVERY: redelivery re-runs the enqueue, which
  is a no-op`). This is the crash-window analogue of `ERROR`’s fallback.

### CALL
Invoke another PROCESS (composition, §11).
- Formal: `CALL <ProcessName>(<args>) → <result>`

### STATE UPDATE / OUTPUT / RISKS
Annotations on a step: a write to declared state (§7), what the step yields, and
known hazards. `OUTPUT` at PROCESS level is its return.

---

## 6. STATE

State is the substance of agentic processes (notes, exclusion lists,
accumulators, session memory). Cairn declares it at a **simple, directional level
inline**, and links to a **definitive definition by number** in a reference
document (the reference-doc format is part of the spec and TBD in detail).

### 6.1 Inline declaration

A `STATE` block names each piece with a **scope**, a **direction**, and a
reference number:

```
STATE
  useful_chunks   [scope: session;  dir: write]      ref: S1
  exclusion_ids   [scope: session;  dir: read/write] ref: S2
  rolling_summary [scope: session;  dir: read/write] ref: S3
```

- **scope** — one of `global | process | session | iteration`.
- **dir** — data-flow direction at this level: `read | write | read/write`
  (think "in / out / in-out").
- **ref** — a number (`S1`, …) pointing to the definitive definition (type,
  invariants, semantics) held in a linked **STATE REFERENCE** document.

### 6.2 Use in steps

Steps reference declared state by name:

```
3. Keep the relevant chunks.
   STATE UPDATE: useful_chunks += kept_ids
```

### 6.3 Why directional + referenced

Inline you see *enough* to read the flow (what state exists, its scope, whether a
step reads or writes it) without clutter; the *definitive* meaning lives once, by
number, in the reference doc. This keeps the main flow human-readable while giving
an AI a precise, executable contract. Scope makes PARALLEL/RECURSE access
explicit (a `session`-scoped value is shared across a session; an `iteration`-
scoped value resets each loop).

### 6.4 Scope semantics

- `global` — lives for the whole description.
- `process` — lives for one run of the PROCESS that declares it.
- `session` — shared across the turns of a session.
- `iteration` — **reset at the start of each ITERATE/QUEUE round.** A value the
  body recomputes each pass is `iteration`-scoped; a value that accumulates
  across passes (e.g. `history`) is `process`-scoped.

### 6.5 STATE and the CALL boundary

A sub-process's STATE is **private by default**. Data crosses a `CALL` only
through its **INPUT / OUTPUT** signature — a caller cannot see or write a callee's
internal state, and vice versa. To share mutable state across a `CALL`, declare it
at a shared scope (`process`/`global`) visible to both, and say so explicitly.
This keeps composition (§10) safe to reason about: a PROCESS is understood from
its signature, not its callees' internals.

---

## 7. Tags

Tags add precision without prose. The reserved set is organised as **orthogonal
dimensions** — at most one value per dimension on a step — plus **namespaced
extensions** for anything custom.

| Dimension | Reserved values |
|---|---|
| **Actor** (owner) | `LLM` · `HUMAN` · `CODE` · `EXTERNAL` |
| **Determinism** | `DETERMINISTIC` · `STOCHASTIC` |
| **Timing** | `SYNC` · `ASYNC` |
| **Effects** | `PURE` · `SIDE-EFFECT` · `IDEMPOTENT` |
| **Control** (optional) | `BLOCKING` · `GATED` (human review) · `CACHED` |

**Domain-specific extensions** (from psychological / organisational / sociological proposals):
- Psychological: `EMOTIONAL` · `COGNITIVE` · `APPRAISAL` · `REGULATION` · `MOTIVATIONAL` · `METACOGNITIVE` · `BEHAVIORAL`
- Organisational: `LEADERSHIP` · `STRATEGIC` · `CULTURAL` · `POWER` · `STAKEHOLDER` · `STRUCTURAL` · `ALIGNMENT` · `RESISTANCE`
- Sociological: `SOCIAL` · `GROUP` · `NORM` · `ROLE` · `SYMBOLIC`

Example: `[LLM, STOCHASTIC, SYNC, SIDE-EFFECT]`.

**Ownership vs. contribution.** The **Actor** dimension names the *accountable
owner* — who decides, approves, and owns the outcome — **not** necessarily who does
the work. To name who *materially contributes* (executes, generates, analyses) use
`ASSISTED-BY`:

- `[HUMAN, ASSISTED-BY: LLM]` — a human owns the decision; an LLM did the framing /
  generation / analysis.
- `ASSISTED-BY` takes one or more actors: `[LLM, ASSISTED-BY: CODE]`,
  `[HUMAN, ASSISTED-BY: LLM, EXTERNAL]`.
- The owner may carry a **role**: `[HUMAN: Product Lead, ASSISTED-BY: LLM]`.

This keeps hybrid human-led / AI-assisted work visible at the top level instead of
hiding it as pure `[HUMAN]` (loses the AI's contribution) or pure `[LLM]` (loses
ownership). The `operator`/`audit` profiles render owner and assistance distinctly
(§3).

A tag may carry a parameter where it sharpens meaning — most usefully the
idempotency key: `IDEMPOTENT [KEY: correlation_id]` (the *what* that makes a repeat
a no-op), and `BATCH [n]` for fan-out size (§5 STEP).

**Extensions:** custom tags are namespaced and visibly non-standard, e.g.
`[x:rerank]`, `[team:billing]`. The reserved vocabulary is expected to **grow
from real use** (describing actual projects), not be fixed up front.

---

## 8. CONTEXT and CONSTRAINTS

- **CONTEXT** — a top-level or per-PROCESS list of definitions / frames /
  background. Provides the bigger picture without cluttering the flow. Referenced
  from steps when helpful.
- **CONSTRAINTS / BOUNDARIES** — limits on a PROCESS or STEP. Inline when short;
  referenced ("See Coherence Rules") when shared or long.

---

## 9. Requirements & Outcomes mode

Cairn expresses requirements **directly**, as testable assertions — distinct from
process steps — so a single document can set the scene, state what must be true,
and describe the flow.

```
REQUIREMENTS
  R1. Retrieval SHALL run entirely on local infrastructure.   [MUST]
      ACCEPTANCE: no network call occurs in the default path.
  R2. The agent SHALL exclude already-returned chunks within a session. [MUST]
  R3. The system SHOULD surface key sources with the answer.  [SHOULD]

OUTCOMES
  A synthesised answer, plus optional transparency (key sources, path,
  confidence).
```

- Each requirement: an id (`R1`), a `SHALL/SHOULD/MAY` assertion, a priority tag
  (`[MUST] | [SHOULD] | [MAY]`), and an optional `ACCEPTANCE` criterion.
- `[MUST]`/`[SHOULD]` are obligations; **`[MAY]` is a capability** — on a step,
  `[SATISFIES: R#]` then means *"supports"*, not *"guarantees"*.
- Process steps reference requirements for traceability: `4. … [SATISFIES: R2]`.
- **A guarantee may be emergent** — satisfied by several steps together, possibly
  across processes or even across separate UI/backend slices. Use either form:
  - **Inline (on a step or OUTCOMES block):**
    `[SATISFIES: R3 — via Ingest.3–4 + Egress.2–3 + consumer dedup on correlation_id]`
  - **Block (at OUTCOMES or parent PROCESS level):**
    ```
    EMERGENT [SATISFIES: R3]
      via Ingest.3–4, Egress.2–3, consumer correlation_id dedup
    ```
  The two forms are equivalent; the block form is easier to read for guarantees
  that no single step owns. Per-step `[SATISFIES]` remains the common case.
- **OUTCOMES** are the expected end-states (what "done" looks like), separate
  from the moment-to-moment OUTPUT of steps.

## 10. Composition (signatures + CALL)

Processes are reusable. A PROCESS declares a signature and can be invoked from a
step:

```
PROCESS Ask (INPUT: user_query; OUTPUT: answer)
  1. CALL Retrieve(user_query) → useful_chunks
  2. Generate the answer from useful_chunks. [LLM]
  OUTPUT: answer

PROCESS Retrieve (INPUT: query; OUTPUT: useful_chunks)
  …
```

`CALL` makes nesting explicit and keeps large systems decomposed into named,
referenceable processes.

## 11. Worked example

The same small agentic-retrieval loop, in both styles. They share the backbone
(numbering, constructs, tags, state).

### 11.1 Formal

```
CONTEXT
  A local LLM retrieves over a graph store under a small context window.

PROCESS Retrieve (INPUT: query; OUTPUT: useful_chunks)
  STATE
    useful_chunks  [scope: session; dir: write]      ref: S1
    exclusion_ids  [scope: session; dir: read/write] ref: S2
    novelty        [scope: iteration; dir: write]     ref: S3

  1. Initialize empty useful_chunks and exclusion_ids.            [CODE, DETERMINISTIC]
  2. ITERATE [UNTIL: novelty < 0.1; MAX: 5]
     2.1 Propose a query plan.                                    [LLM, STOCHASTIC, SYNC]
         CONSTRAINTS: choose one of the fixed query primitives.
     2.2 Execute the plan and gate candidates.                    [CODE, DETERMINISTIC]
         STATE UPDATE: exclusion_ids += returned_ids
     2.3 Evaluate the shortlist for relevance.                    [LLM, STOCHASTIC]
         STATE UPDATE: useful_chunks += kept_ids
     2.4 Update novelty from new-vs-excluded ratio.               [CODE, DETERMINISTIC]
  3. CALL Synthesize(useful_chunks) → answer.                     [LLM] [SATISFIES: R1]
  OUTPUT: answer
  RISKS: a weak local model may mis-judge relevance; the Python gate (2.2) bounds it.
```

### 11.2 Narrative (same backbone)

```
PROCESS — Retrieve an answer for a user query.

  1. Start with an empty "useful" set and an empty "already-seen" set.
  2. Loop — at most five rounds, stopping early when little new turns up:
     2.1 The model proposes a query plan, choosing one of the allowed search
         primitives.
     2.2 Run the plan; record everything returned so it isn't fetched again.
     2.3 The model judges the shortlist and keeps what's genuinely relevant.
     2.4 Measure how much of this round was new; that drives the stop decision.
  3. Hand the kept chunks to the Synthesize process to write the answer.

  Risk: a small model can mis-judge relevance, so a deterministic filter in 2.2
  bounds what it ever sees.
```

## 12. Conformance (structural)

Cairn descriptions are free-text inside a light structural skeleton. A description
is **well-formed** if:

1. it contains at least one of CONTEXT, REQUIREMENTS/OUTCOMES, or PROCESS;
2. every PROCESS has a name (and a signature when it takes input / returns
   output);
3. steps are consistently numbered and nested;
4. reserved tags use at most one value per dimension (§7); custom tags are
   namespaced;
5. every `STATE UPDATE` names a piece declared in a `STATE` block;
6. LLM-driven `ITERATE` / `RECURSE` carry a bound (`MAX` / `MAX_DEPTH`);
7. `BREAK` / `CONTINUE` appear only inside a loop (`ITERATE` / `QUEUE`);
8. every `AWAIT` states a `TIMEOUT` (a value or `never`).

Descriptions (the prose in each step) are intentionally **not** constrained —
that is where human readability lives. Tooling validates the skeleton, not the
words.

A minimal structural grammar (EBNF) for the skeleton is in
[GRAMMAR.md](GRAMMAR.md). It defines the structure; step descriptions stay free
text.

## 13. Usage modes and orchestration

Cairn can be used as a package/CLI surface, a local or remote LLM orchestration
library, a manual agent-analysis scaffold for GitHub links or process files, an
embedded governance library, or a CI/review-gate tool.

Manual agent-driven analysis SHOULD use a versioned Cairn orchestration pattern,
such as `docs/orchestration/manual-agent-analysis.cairn.md`, rather than an
ad-hoc prompt. The pattern SHOULD require explicit OKF concept traceability for
human-factors findings, augmentation findings, interface recommendations, and
reports.

If the manual analysis happens inside an interactive agentic harness that can
execute code, the harness SHOULD use Cairn's Python APIs and CLI commands for
repeatable validation, deterministic analysis, recommendation generation, and
report assembly. Manual agent analysis is therefore not necessarily prompt-only;
the agent may orchestrate Cairn libraries and then interpret the result for the
human.

Runtime telemetry, dashboards, and product-specific usage analytics are outside
the core language contract and SHOULD be separated unless they become portable
semantic contracts.

## 14. Versioning & evolution

The version numbers below are **specification** versions — they track the language,
not the implementation. The Python package (`cairn-lang`) is versioned separately in
`pyproject.toml` and `CHANGELOG.md` and tagged in git; the two are not expected to
match. See the Status section of [README.md](README.md) for the current pairing.

- **v0.9** adds versioned live `PLAN` envelopes for bounded recursive revision of a complete `PROCESS` backbone.
- **v0.8** adds **render profiles** (the `ai`/`operator`/`executive`/`audit`
  projections of one backbone, §3), **ownership vs. contribution**
  (`Actor` = owner + `ASSISTED-BY`, §7), and `MILESTONE` / `PURPOSE` to feed the
  human-facing profiles — from feedback after modelling an end-to-end
  human-led, AI-assisted delivery process.
- v0.7 was the first stress-tested release. It supersedes the v0.6 draft
  (shared-backbone dual style, scoped+referenced STATE, progressive-formality
  modifiers, tag dimensions + extensions, requirements/outcomes mode, composition,
  conformance) and folds in everything learned from describing three real systems:
  `SERVICE`/`CONCURRENT`, `AWAIT`, `ATOMIC`/`DURABLE-BEFORE`/`RECOVERY`,
  `BREAK`/`CONTINUE`, parameterised tags, and emergent `[SATISFIES]`.
- Cairn evolves from real use. The reserved verbs and tags grow as the language is
  applied to actual projects; changes are recorded in
  [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
- The first stress test is describing three real systems (Tirzah, Hoglah,
  Mahalath) in Cairn — see `examples/`.
